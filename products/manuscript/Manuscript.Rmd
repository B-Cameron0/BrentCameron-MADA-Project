# Summary/Abstract
_Write a summary of your project._

I will analyze data to further understand trend of COVID-19 deaths in the United States using geographical data from the CDC open database. The goal of this project is to understand the role that age group, geography, ethnicity, and underlying conditions play in the overall spread, managment, and handling of COVID-19. This project will hopefully shed further light into what could be the best targeted approaches for minimizing disease burden for similar diseases in the future.


# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis_ 

The word Coronavirus has grown from a seemingly harmless word for a virus that can create cold and flu-like symptoms, to one of the most recognizable and fear-inducing words worldwide in the sphere of disease. COVID-19 has been responsible for simultaneously one of the most prevalent worldwide pandemics in decades, and one of the most intricate and complex systems of partnerships, vaccination campaigns, and mobilizations to stop the disease worldwide. Because of the vast scope of this virus, resources and networks have been tested, created, and managed, often in completely new areas and capacities. While a multitude of research has already been conducted on COVID-19, including dealing with a variety of recent strains such as Alpha, Delta, and most recently, Mu, understnading the differences in how the disease continues to affect and interact with different populations can serve as an invaluable resource in tailoring new innovative strategies to combat the virus.

## Description of data and data source
_Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc. Eventually this might be part of a methods section._

The data used in this project is a compilation of information regarding COVID-19 cases based on state, county, age group, whether hospitalization or death resulted from the virus, and whether or not there was an underlying condition (*note that this data only involves information collected from the United States). The data comes from the CDC open database and can be found here: 

*https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4*

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
_State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis._

COVID-19 has been and will continue to be widely studied- however, with the presence of constantly evolving data and mutations of the virus, new research and data analysis can shed light on how the disease is changing or how well the effectiveness of our virus containment and elimination strategies are working (or failing). With that being said, there are several questions in particular that I will ask and attempt to answer through this research project:

*Is COVID-19 proliferation dependent on or affected by geographical location in the United States? If so, in what ways?

*How does age factor into susceptibility of the virus? Will the past research concluding that the extremely old are the most vulnerable to the virus continue to be held evident?

*Does ethnicity play a role in the handling of the virus? If there is a difference between certain ethnicities and racial groups in the overall disease burden through the virus, why would that be the case? (E.G. Presence of a good support system or lack thereof, high religious affiliation, healthier overall living, etc.)

*Does the presence of a pre-existing condition have an affect on the proliferation and or outcome of the disease? If so, what pre-existing conditions have the largest affect on the individual?

These questions will serve as valuable starting points that, if possible, will allow for deeper data analysis and cross analysis to determine synergy between variables and geographies (how is overall socioeconomic status different in this location? Is overall living more healthy?). While some of these questions posed such as SES and quality of diet cannot be answered from the CDC data alone, further research in topics of interest will elucidate these questions and allow for a greater reinforcement of already established research and data analysis. 



# Methods and Results

_In most research papers, results and methods are separate. You can combine them here if you find it easier. You are also welcome to structure things such that those are separate sections._


## Data aquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._

## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._


## Exploratory analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. You should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. FIgures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data._

_Continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables. Plots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones._

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. t-tests, simple regression model with 1 predictor, etc.) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._

Table \@ref(tab:summarytable) shows a table summarizing the data.


```{r summarytable,  echo=FALSE}
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Data summary table.')
```


Figure \@ref(fig:resultfigure) shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r resultfigure,  fig.cap='Analysis figure.', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../results/resultfigure.png")
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example table \@ref(tab:resulttable) shows a table summarizing a linear model fit.

```{r resulttable,  echo=FALSE}
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/resulttable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Linear model fit table.')
```


# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@Leek2015a] discusses types of analyses. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
