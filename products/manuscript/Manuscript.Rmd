# Summary/Abstract
_Write a summary of your project._

I will analyze data to further understand trend of cancer mortality trends from 1999-2017 in the United States using data collected via the CDC wonder website. The goal of this project is to understand the role that age group, sex, ethnicity, and race play in the overall cancer trends from 1999-2017. This project will hopefully shed further light into what could be the best targeted approaches for minimizing disease burden for cancer in the future. 


# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis_ 

The word cancer has long been one of the most recognizable and fear-inducing words worldwide in the sphere of chronic disease. Cancer, along with heart disease and diabetes, are responsible for the leading causes of death and disability in the United States (according to the Center for Disease Control-https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/index.htm#:~:text=Chronic%20diseases%20such%20as%20heart,disability%20in%20the%20United%20States). Because of the vast scope and many different types of the disease, resources and networks have been continually strained in identifying the most efficient and effective ways to counteract cancerous cells. While a multitude of research has already been conducted on cancer, understanding the differences in how the disease continues to affect and interact with different populations can serve as an invaluable resource in tailoring new innovative strategies to combat the disease.

## Description of data and data source
_Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc. Eventually this might be part of a methods section._

The data used in this project is a compilation of information regarding cancer mortality cases from 1999-2017 based on age group, sex, ethnicity. race, and cancer sites (*note that this data only includes information collected from the United States). The data comes from the CDC wonder website and can be found here: 

*https://wonder.cdc.gov/cancermort-v2017.HTML

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
_State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis._

Cancer has been and will continue to be widely studied- however, with the presence of constantly evolving data and new research shedding light on innovative techniques and approaches to better manage and control the disease, new examinations of data trends can provide a valuable framework for future studies. With that being said, there are several questions in particular that I will ask and attempt to answer through this research project:

*Are cancer mortality trends dependent on or affected by race in the United States? If so, in what ways?

*How does age factor into mortality trends of cancer? Will the past research concluding that the elderly are the most vulnerable continue to be held evident?

*Does ethnicity play a role in either further susceptibility or resilience to cancer (more or less cancer deaths for certain ethnic groups)? If there is a difference between trends for certain ethnicities in the overall disease burden why would that be the case? (E.G. Presence of a good support system or lack thereof, high religious affiliation, healthier overall living, etc.)

*Does the particular cancer site have an affect on the outcome of the disease? If so, what sites have the largest mortality relative to the number of cases? 

These questions will serve as valuable starting points that, if possible, will allow for deeper data analysis to determine synergy between variables (do certain races or ethnicities have a higher propensity for cancer in certain sites? Are there trends between sex and age group relative to cancer mortality trends?). While some of these questions posed may not be able to be fully explored and answered with the data set utilized here, further research in topics of interest will elucidate these questions and allow for a greater reinforcement of already established research and data analysis regarding cancer and its disease burden.



# Methods and Results

_In most research papers, results and methods are separate. You can combine them here if you find it easier. You are also welcome to structure things such that those are separate sections._


## Data aquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._

## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._


## Exploratory analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. You should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. FIgures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data._

_Continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables. Plots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones._

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. t-tests, simple regression model with 1 predictor, etc.) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._

Table \@ref(tab:summarytable) shows a table summarizing the data.


```{r summarytable,  echo=FALSE}
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Data summary table.')
```


Figure \@ref(fig:resultfigure) shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r resultfigure,  fig.cap='Analysis figure.', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../results/resultfigure.png")
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example table \@ref(tab:resulttable) shows a table summarizing a linear model fit.

```{r resulttable,  echo=FALSE}
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/resulttable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Linear model fit table.')
```


# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@Leek2015a] discusses types of analyses. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
