   abstract = {Epidemiological studies point to race as a determining factor in cancer susceptibility. In US registries recording cancer incidence and survival by race (distinguishing ‘black versus white’), individuals of African ancestry have a globally increased risk of malignancies compared with Caucasians and Asian Americans. Differences in socioeconomic status and health-care access play a key role. However, the lesser disease susceptibility of Hispanic populations with comparable lifestyles and socioeconomic status as African Americans (Hispanic paradox) points to the concomitant importance of genetic determinants. Here, we overview the molecular basis of racial disparity in cancer susceptibility ranging from genetic polymorphisms and cancer-driver gene mutations to obesity, chronic inflammation, and immune responses. We discuss implications for race-adapted cancer screening programs and clinical trials to reduce disparities in cancer burden.},

   abstract = {Importance: Information about stage of cancer at diagnosis, use of therapy, and survival among patients from different racial/ethnic groups with 1 of the most common cancers is lacking. Objective: To assess stage of cancer at diagnosis, use of therapy, overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients with cancer from different racial/ethnic groups. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included 950377 Asian, black, white, and Hispanic patients who were diagnosed with prostate, ovarian, breast, stomach, pancreatic, lung, liver, esophageal, or colorectal cancers from January 2004 to December 2010. Data were collected using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, and patients were observed for more than 5 years. Data analysis was conducted in July 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Multivariable logistic and Cox regression were used to evaluate the differences in stage of cancer at diagnosis, treatment, and survival among patients from different racial/ethnic groups. Results: A total of 950377 patients (499070 [52.5%] men) were included in the study, with 681251 white patients (71.7%; mean [SD] age, 65 [12] years), 116015 black patients (12.2%; mean [SD] age, 62 [12] years), 65718 Asian patients (6.9%; mean [SD] age, 63 [13] years), and 87393 Hispanic patients (9.2%; mean [SD] age, 61 [13] years). Compared with Asian patients, black patients were more likely to have metastatic disease at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.144; 95% CI, 1.109-1.180; P <.001). Black and Hispanic patients were less likely to receive definitive treatment than Asian patients (black: adjusted OR, 0.630; 95% CI, 0.609-0.653; P <.001; Hispanic: adjusted OR, 0.751; 95% CI, 0.724-0.780; P <.001). White, black, and Hispanic patients were more likely to have poorer CSS and OS than Asian patients (CSS, white: adjusted HR, 1.310; 95% CI, 1.283-1.338; P <.001; black: adjusted HR, 1.645; 95% CI, 1.605-1.685; P <.001; Hispanic: adjusted HR, 1.300; 95% CI, 1.266-1.334; P <.001; OS, white: adjusted HR, 1.333; 95% CI, 1.310-1.357; P <.001; black: adjusted HR, 1.754; 95% CI, 1.719-1.789; P <.001; Hispanic: adjusted HR, 1.279; 95% CI, 1.269-1.326; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of patients with 1 of 9 leading cancers, stage at diagnosis, treatment, and survival were different by race and ethnicity. These findings may help to optimize treatment and improve outcomes..},

   abstract = {There are well-established disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes by race/ethnicity that result from the interplay between structural, socioeconomic, socio-environmental, behavioural and biological factors. However, large research studies designed to investigate factors contributing to cancer aetiology and progression have mainly focused on populations of European origin. The limitations in clinicopathological and genetic data, as well as the reduced availability of biospecimens from diverse populations, contribute to the knowledge gap and have the potential to widen cancer health disparities. In this review, we summarise reported disparities and associated factors in the United States of America (USA) for the most common cancers (breast, prostate, lung and colon), and for a subset of other cancers that highlight the complexity of disparities (gastric, liver, pancreas and leukaemia). We focus on populations commonly identified and referred to as racial/ethnic minorities in the USA—African Americans/Blacks, American Indians and Alaska Natives, Asians, Native Hawaiians/other Pacific Islanders and Hispanics/Latinos. We conclude that even though substantial progress has been made in understanding the factors underlying cancer health disparities, marked inequities persist. Additional efforts are needed to include participants from diverse populations in the research of cancer aetiology, biology and treatment. Furthermore, to eliminate cancer health disparities, it will be necessary to facilitate access to, and utilisation of, health services to all individuals, and to address structural inequities, including racism, that disproportionally affect racial/ethnic minorities in the USA.},

   abstract = {There are limited published data on recent cancer incidence and mortality trends worldwide. We used the International Agency for Research on Cancer's CANCERMondial clearing-house to present age-standardized cancer incidence and death rates for 2003-2007. We also present trends in incidence through 2007 and mortality through 2012 for select countries from five continents. High-income countries (HIC) continue to have the highest incidence rates for all sites, as well as for lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, although some low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) now count among those with the highest rates. Mortality rates from these cancers are declining in many HICs while they are increasing in LMICs. LMICs have the highest rates of stomach, liver, esophageal, and cervical cancer. Although rates remain high in HICs, they are plateauing or decreasing for the most common cancers due to decreases in known risk factors, screening and early detection, and improved treatment (mortality only). In contrast, rates in several LMICs are increasing for these cancers due to increases in smoking, excess body weight, and physical inactivity. LMICs also have a disproportionate burden of infection-related cancers. Applied cancer control measures are needed to reduce rates in HICs and arrest the growing burden in LMICs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND The overall age-standardized cancer incidence rate continues to decline whereas the number of cases diagnosed each year increases. Predicting cancer incidence can help to anticipate future resource needs, evaluate primary prevention strategies, and inform research. METHODS Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data were used to estimate the number of cancers (all sites) resulting from changes in population risk, age, and size. The authors projected to 2020 nationwide age-standardized incidence rates and cases (including the top 23 cancers). RESULTS Since 1975, incident cases increased among white individuals, primarily caused by an aging white population, and among black individuals, primarily caused by an increasing black population. Between 2010 and 2020, it is expected that overall incidence rates (proxy for risk) will decrease slightly among black men and stabilize in other groups. By 2020, the authors predict annual cancer cases (all races, all sites) to increase among men by 24.1% (-3.2% risk and 27.3% age/growth) to >1 million cases, and by 20.6% among women (1.2% risk and 19.4% age/growth) to >900,000 cases. The largest increases are expected for melanoma (white individuals); cancers of the prostate, kidney, liver, and urinary bladder in males; and the lung, breast, uterus, and thyroid in females. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the authors predict cancer incidence rates/risk to stabilize for the majority of the population; however, they expect the number of cancer cases to increase by >20%. A greater emphasis on primary prevention and early detection is needed to counter the effect of an aging and growing population on the burden of cancer.},
